<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Greg. I bake a little bread, make sausage sometimes, and used to do surface science research. Nowadays I do a bit of&nbsp;programming. </p>
<p>As a bit of background, I majored in chemistry as an undergraduate at the University of California, Riverside, where after telling my chemistry teaching assistance about my interest in doing research, I joined Professor Ludwig Bartels&#8217; lab. Little did I know that I would stick around past my undergraduate education for a total of 8 years and come out with a PhD in chemistry. After that, I joined Professor James K. Gimzewski&#8217;s laboratory at the University of California, Los Angeles for 5 years as a postdoctoral scholar. From there I got a job as a purveyor of scientific instrumentation with Oxford Instruments, which was then bought out by Scienta Omicron. Realizing that perhaps life on the road was not for me, I decided to pursue data science, enrolled in the Springboard data science course, and started to work with some non-profit institutions doing ad-hoc reporting and donor analysis. Aside from cooking and music, I also am interested in transportation issues and the homelessness crisis in Los Angeles. I am a project lead for the <a href="https://www.hackforla.org/projects/lucky-parking">Lucky Parking Project</a> which seeks to provide a tool for the community and city planners to better visualize the effects of parking policies. I also am on the board of <a href="https://www.nvcsinc.org/">North Valley Caring Services</a>, a local food pantry, providing them with ad-hoc reports to aid with&nbsp;fundraising.</p>
