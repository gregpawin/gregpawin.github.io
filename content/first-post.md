After days of 24/7 speculation, we finally get a result. It was interesting to see the tools people built to publish minute by minute vote tallys.

Here's a vote scraper created by the NYTimes: [https://github.com/alex/nyt-2020-election-scraper](https://github.com/alex/nyt-2020-election-scraper)

If the site is still up past the election, here's the table of vote tallys that their scraper powers: [https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html#](https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html#)

It's based off of a project by Simon Willson: [Git scraping: track changes over time by scraping to a Git repository](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/), which uses a Git repo to scrape data to with very little code. Definitely something to keep in mind for future projects.
