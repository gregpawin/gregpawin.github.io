As a bit of background, I majored in chemistry at the University of California, Riverside, where I built instrumentation and studied the properties of single molecules or single films of molecules.  After that, I worked at the University of California, Los Angeles for 5 years as a postdoctoral scholar. From there I got a job as a purveyor of scientific instrumentation. Realizing that life on the road was not for me, I decided to pursue data science, enrolled in the Springboard data science course, and started to work for some non-profit institutions. 

Aside from cooking and music, I also am interested in transportation issues and the homelessness crisis in Los Angeles. I am a project lead for the [Lucky Parking Project](https://www.hackforla.org/projects/lucky-parking) which seeks to provide a tool for the community and city planners to better visualize the effects of parking policies. I also am on the board of [North Valley Caring Services](https://www.nvcsinc.org/), a local food pantry, providing them with ad-hoc reports to aid with fundraising.
