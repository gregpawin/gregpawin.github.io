Hi, I'm Greg. I bake a little bread, make sausage sometimes, and used to do surface science research. Nowadays I do a bit of programming. 

As a bit of background, I majored in chemistry as an undergraduate at the University of California, Riverside, where I joined Professor Ludwig Bartels' lab building scanning tunneling microscopes and studying the properties of single molecules or single films of molecules. Eight years later I and come out with a PhD in chemistry. After that, I joined Professor James K. Gimzewski's laboratory at the University of California, Los Angeles for 5 years as a postdoctoral scholar. From there I got a job as a purveyor of scientific instrumentation with Oxford Instruments, which was then bought out by Scienta Omicron. Realizing that life on the road was not for me, I decided to pursue data science, enrolled in the Springboard data science course, and started to work for some non-profit institutions. 

Aside from cooking and music, I also am interested in transportation issues and the homelessness crisis in Los Angeles. I am a project lead for the [Lucky Parking Project](https://www.hackforla.org/projects/lucky-parking) which seeks to provide a tool for the community and city planners to better visualize the effects of parking policies. I also am on the board of [North Valley Caring Services](https://www.nvcsinc.org/), a local food pantry, providing them with ad-hoc reports to aid with fundraising.
